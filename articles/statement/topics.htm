  <p>
    When there is so much to write about it is narrowing down the options available 
    before the product of the article is made known.  The topic is some specific theme 
    which is of interest to the author.  When deciding what to write about it may be 
    considered useful to make preparations with the selection process.  The topic must 
    be of some interest to the reader and of course the author has to have enthusiasm 
    too.  
  </p>
  <p>
    There are then the range of potential topics from history, mathematics, software 
    development and physics.  Each of these subjects could be explored where by finding 
    specific themes from each field the main points could then be examined.
