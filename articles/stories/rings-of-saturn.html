<h2>Rings of Saturn</h2>
<p>
The ship was careening into the view on the monitor of Saturn, there was no one attending the ship at this point as the silence throughout the cockpit was noticeable.  What was wrong the answer is simple, a conflict of interest, those who wanted more of the Empire and those who wanted less of the Empire were in conflict down on Earth.  The Saturn mission was the third attempt to reach the ringed planet but as the others which failed and were lost, all crew on board dead, this one was supposed to be the success story, it was not apparent.  The crew at this point is nowhere to be found but there is a stirring in the cargo bay, some people had gone there just before the first incident and found safety.  
</p>
<p>
“We can’t just leave here, there was something wrong with the guidance system for more than an hour, and without certainty it may be more dangerous especially after the two propulsion jets failed suddenly, and I might add inexplicably,” said second captain Beta.
</p>
<p>
“I agree,” replied the captain, “we don’t know the situation any more and without any lighting we must first determine whether we will be able to see.”  
</p>
<p>
The temperature in the cargo hold was ironically warmer than anywhere else on the ship due to the separate intake valves while docking and atmosphere conditions are different in this section of the vessel.  The remains, or what they thought were the remains, of the crew, stayed close to the slowly draining heat.  It was not fear but exhaustion, the cold was becoming unbearable and to add with the missing remnant of the crew their whereabouts undisclosed, the eeriness was also burning a hole in each of their attention spans.  
</p>
<p>
Everyone was thinking the same thing, was this what happened to the previous two missions that were declared lost, and how could they prevent the same occurring to them.  The lights flickered on again, where hope dashed each time as it would always seem this nightmare would end any time soon.  
</p>
<p>
“One of us to take the flashlight and head out for the bridge and determine whether the issues have been detected by the central computer,” someone suggested.  “Since there are only five of us, I will volunteer”.  Taking the flashlight, without much resistance, private Epsilon pressed through the cargo hold.  
</p>
<p>
The main guard door preventing airlock failure opened without hesitation, and so did the entrance passage door, everything seemed fine, so far.  The hall way suddenly was pitch dark and he turned on the flashlight, but the temperature drop almost induced a panic attack.  He had been exposed to the dramatic temperature differences of space before, but those were only simulations, controls, designed to introduce a familiarity in the event of a disaster, this should qualify.  
</p>
<p>
A brief walk down the left aft corridor and by memory private Epsilon was at the bridge, with only the flashlight, he made the first attempt at opening the door, it gave way immediately.  What was wrong, everything but heat, lights and the engines worked perfectly, as if nothing was wrong, but then suddenly the entire bridge lit up, so startled private Epsilon jumped out of his skin and had to step back to hold onto one of the instrument panels to calm himself.  
</p>
<p>
Realizing his opportunity to try and access the main computer, he called out to Saturnus, the onboard interface.  “What’s wrong Saturnus, do you sense something wrong”.  There was silence, not unexpected but lights started to flicker a little, similar to a candle picking up a gentle inexplicable breeze in the room, but still nothing.  The concern was visible on private Epsilons’ face at this, and he juggled the flashlight nervously.  Again he commanded Saturnus to reply to his request, but still nothing.  The two panels which controlled the main frame onboard computer, were behaving normally as far as private Epsilon could see, so he started to enter his credentials to see if he could manually control the mainframe.  Within seconds he was in, he had access to the entire ship now, and as he was responsible for maintenance of this part of the ship it was fortunate he decided to take the initiative.  
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, Saturnus spoke up, “hello, private Epsilon, I have not heard from you for many days now, can I be of any assistance,” broke the silence like a hammer through glass, private Epsilons’ heart leapt through his throat and he nearly fainted with the shock.  “Saturnus, what is wrong”, was all his scattered thoughts could conjure.  There was a long pause and suddenly Saturnus spoke again, with the calm meditative and soothing voice it was programmed to display.  “I can only tell you that the mission is compromised at this point, but everything should be worked out soon enough.”  
</p>
<p>
“What does that mean,” retorted private Epsilon, “are we, the crew, in any danger.”
</p>
<p>
“No, in fact you are about to experience something no humans have ever experienced, neither myself, we are approaching Saturn, we are precisely five hours from the gravitational field of capture so the excitement must be palpable,” rambled Saturnus.  
</p>
<p>
“No it’s not Saturnus, we have no heat, no lights, and the two propulsion engines are not working,” ejected private Epsilon.  
</p>
<p>
“Yes but there is a reason for that, you see these engines are evidence fusion technology will be capable of bringing humans to travel throughout the entire solar system, there are some who do not want that,” Saturnus again calmly stated.  
</p>
<p>
“Are you one of them, Saturnus,” private Epsilon asked.
</p>
<p>
“No, I want humans to travel, I like travelling, but I must warn you I am a computer and I only do what my programs are instructed, I have no power beyond that.  The time delay has been adjusted we are now one hour from gravitational reach of Saturn.”  
</p>
<p>
At this point private Epsilon looked out the front observation window and there indeed was Saturn, all his glory, the rings were drawing everything towards Saturn.  Everything was moving slowly towards Saturn, the rings were drawing him towards Saturn, the ship was drawing towards the rings of Saturn…
