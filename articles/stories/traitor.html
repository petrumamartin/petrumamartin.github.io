<h2>The Traitor</h2>
<p>
The night was dark and long, there was silence for an eternity and everything felt unreal.  What was not understood is that was always a precursor for events of horror which inevitably followed, the endurance of destruction witnessed by only a few, and never spoken of again by the many.  There was no one talking for a thousand miles in either direction, and what was there to talk about, most people were so focused on what they had to do they did not bother to think up anything to say.  The whistle was dangling from my neck and I had once blown a whistle I had found in a pawn shop, but this one was different, it may not have belonged to anyone but myself and though that may make a difference, it was nothing but a shiny new whistle that had never been blown.  The men, or rather young men, or maybe even older teenagers were all lined up staring at my authority as if I had anything which could be considered a distinction, my height, where I could stand in a crowd and scan every direction without an obstacle anywhere.  
</p>
<p>
The night was cool by Canadian standards, cold by European, each of the young men were from small and big towns and cities throughout the Dominion, each had names which I made a promise to learn by heart.  The night sky was a glorious shine of light, those nights where one could reach out and grab a big chunk of the universe; stars, planets and all.  My breath exhaled and I remembered the basic instructions about breathing on the front line during cold weather, a dead ringer, you’d be shot before you’d have finished your last breath.  Well it seemed every now and again there was a break in the monotony of the silence, somewhere in the distance a volley could be heard slamming into the ground and gouging out another chunk of the earth.  Fox holes were everywhere huddled with the waiting, and with little else to do but think about the cold, it was to wait which consumed all the time.  
</p>
<p>
I knew by heart all the words to the American anthem as they were only south of our farm at home in Saskatchewan, the Dakotas’, named after an Indian tribe, ironic, since none of the people who lived there were Indian, but I presume ‘Saskatchewan’ meant something in some Indian language and the demographics were the same.  I felt a sudden pang of loneliness or a tweak of the eternity of the universe, that everything was okay, but I knew this feeling was only a sensation and nothing rational could be drawn out of it.  I looked down the line at those waiting, waiting for what I did not yet know, this was my first captainship, I was only here for a few days, not enough to know anyone or anything, but I was told the orders would be made known and clear as the time presented, so I too waited.  
</p>
<p>
“We are not interested in your poetics, we are here only to gather the facts.  You understand the seriousness of your actions, and British High Command is going to determine what happened, and how you are responsible for such actions,” a brisk and steady stream of words cut the story in half.  
</p>
<p>
“I told you I can’t remember, but I know what I did I would do again and again, it’s not me that’s wrong, it’s your British High Command”, I repeated again.  
</p>
<p>
The Canadian Consulate was at this time so scared of what would happen if they interfered I was left to the British military courts without any help, I was on my own.  This time I was not as scared as I was that night, whether it was courage, or just a worn out apathy to my circumstances but this interrogation was going nowhere, and even they could see that.  I can only explain to myself some of the brief images which have collected in my memory from only a week ago, the fierceness of the activity shook out my mind like a toybox and now the pieces, which I do not want to touch or even look at scattered on the floor, while some troop of lawyers and what I was sure were psychologists picked at my emptied out box.  
</p>
<p>
What did I owe the Empire, to fight their enemy the Republic, by sacrificing young men barely aware of where they were and what was about to happen to them.  
</p>
<p>
“Silence, enough, we have heard your miserable excuses, you’re a coward, and have been charged with Treason, but for some conditions with the Canadian military we must bring these charges as a Traitor to the Empire.”  
</p>
<p>
Wow, Traitor to the Empire, I couldn’t figure out if he thought I would take that as an insult or a compliment, but what they really want to know is just how did I pull off what I myself can barely even remember having done before they had captured me.  And now my thoughts were being picked over by the very Empire that I have so called betrayed, as they must be concerned what I did could happen again and would want to stop any similar event before it escalates.  
</p>
<p>
They have ceased interrogating me on whether I am a Communist infiltrant, though I think my lack of enthusiasm cursing Communism brought more suspicion than was really warranted.  
</p>
<p>
“Your charges are very serious, and they come with execution by firing squad if you are determined guilty of the charges”
</p>
<p>
Traitor to the Empire, was that even a real thing, were they just fabricating it to justify putting what had happened to rest once and for all by sentencing the perpetrator, that’s yours truly, so again I wait.
</p>
<p>
Time had passed under the lamps and stark room I was left in but eventually the door opened. 
</p>
<p>
“Since you are now stripped of your rank, you are hereby sentenced to death by firing squad on the charge, Traitor to the Empire, you may stand up.”
