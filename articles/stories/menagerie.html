<h2>The Menagerie</h2>
<p>
“I told you I only want the fighting to stop!”, was her repeated reply.  
“What we want to know is who has told you to do this?”, a deep voice uttered, frustrated with the unending delays of the interrogation.  “We have waited patiently for you to comprehend the circumstances you find yourself, you have offended both the French and English Armies for your attempts to undermine confidence, now where did you get the motivation to do what you have done.”  
</p>
<p>
“I only know what is good and true, you have made the world miserable with your killing and you will stop, now”, the dry and exhausted voice of a young girl no more than fifteen, stated.  
</p>
<p>
“Why did you stand in the middle of a battle between the French and the English, grabbing their swords from their hands, what has possessed you to behave in such a manner, do you understand you are offending many, even those in heaven for your actions.”  
</p>
<p>
There is a long pause, staring at the ground of her cell where she has been detained without contact with any person, her hair greasy and dangling past her ears, she turns her eyes up to the bishop and absently looking into space, right through the bishop she repeats, “my God has a place for me and I know I am doing what he would want and whatever you are saying I did or did not do, is no longer important to me, I wait only to know what you will do to me.”  
</p>
<p>
The bishop turns to the door where a guard waits and commands him to send Father X, “maybe the Father X whom you have trusted will be able to get anything from you.”  At that the Bishop leaves the cell and the young girl putting her hands to her sides on the small cot she is sitting on pushes her exhausted body up to stand on her feet and walks to the window, staring at the courtyard below she sighs and turns towards the door to wait for Father X.  
</p>
<p>
A delay that appears to her as almost planned, the Father walks into the room, he believes he has established a rapport with the young maid but is uncertain it has brought anyone any closer to understanding why she is persisting in her actions and to know that what she is doing is the highest of treason against both the church and the state.  “I hope you are doing well Joan of Orleans, it seems to me every time we speak your English improves and I certainly hope my French does as well.”  There is a small smile that pushes up from her face as she returns to the window to see the court below.  
</p>
<p>
“What do you want to ask me today, something I have not told you again and again,” replies the girl turning towards the priest, her eyes cast down to the ground again, waiting, for what, for who, it is unclear, but steady as if there is no other purpose, no other reason, she has fate on her side but does not sense the power of her resolve.  “I understand you Joan, you have great concerns about how the English and French are always at war and you have decided, of your own reasoning, that it must all stop, but what I have repeated to you again and again, there are many who disagree with you, and though you may not be able to understand that this fighting which you so abhor cannot end at your insistence you persist in a most unusual manner that has proved troublesome to some very powerful people, including the King of France.  What you may not truly understand is their patience for your antics every time they engage in the fighting, where you run onto the field and demand the soldiers stop killing one another is baffling too many and upsetting what you do not comprehend.”  
</p>
<p>
“I do not hate fighting, I want peace, peace, stop, no more,” she grabs the clumps of greasy brown hair draped around her head, pressing her hands to her ears, closing her eyes fiercely and shakes her head back and forth, “enough, enough” exasperated her hands fall to her sides and she stares quietly into the priests eyes.  
</p>
<p>
“If you do not confess Joan that someone has put you up to this and that it was never your intention to intervene in these engagements, I have no other options than to hand you over to a military court, which will not be merciful on the acts of sedition you have infused the troops on both sides against their superiors.”  With his hands genuinely clasped together, Father X pleads with Joan of Arc to confess that it was an act of possession on her part, she can be forgiven by the Church and leniency will be awarded.  
</p>
<p>
“I know what will happen, you will forget what I said today, yesterday, and everyday, you must stop killing one another, stop killing each other, there is only death everywhere, my brother, my neighbours father, and for what, you kings who squabble and stab at one another for nothing, stop, and I will confess anything you want.”  
</p>
<p>
“Joan you must know I have no power to do any of these things, neither do you, you have draw some soldiers away from attending to their duties and stirred others on both sides to doubt their purposes, but that is wrong, you must understand.”  
</p>
<p>
“I don’t, I won’t, you are wrong, they are wrong,” she exclaims.
</p>
<p>
“This is out of my hands, the Church will not defend you and they are going to burn you at the stake,” pleads the priest again.  
</p>
<p>
“Then so be it, I will accept death if I must, maybe someone will hear my voice, I am not afraid, you are all wrong, I know the truth and what Christ would want, and he would never bless what all of you have done.”
