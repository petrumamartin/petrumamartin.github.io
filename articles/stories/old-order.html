<h2>Old Order</h2>
<p>
There was a sound, a crackling noise could be heard, suddenly a voice sounded out in the darkness.  What followed was an onslaught of gun fire those present hardly aware of what was happening burst into action.  Towards the back of the schoolhouse an explosion, there was no doubt what was happening.  The first thing Comrade Solzheim thought the whites have shown up to complete their objective and it was his orders to maintain until the end protection of the Royal Family.  The morning wore on slowly after the initial assault and that was what begins this sequence of events.  
</p>
<p>
The prevsiou early morning brought the usual set of operations, the waking of the hostages and the preparations for the days routine.  First food was served as the tastes of the time, and the dressing, grooming and cleaning were performed.  The activities would revolve around playing music and singing and other educational training, this was all initiated before lunch.  The rest of the day was also as mundane and simple as the morning, and keeping busy was the purpose of all other plans.  
</p>
<p>
The phone rings, and comrade Tirbaniski answering, “Comrade Solzheim, it is Comrade Lenin, he wishes to speak directly to you.”
</p>
<p>
Solzheim takes the receiver and while adjusting his uniform unconsciously, he stands erect and answers, “Hello, Comrade Lenin, what can I do for you?”, there is a moment of pause as the sound of a voice from the other side of the line continues.  Then Solzheim pausing before answering says he will act out his instructions, “We understand that you Comrade Lenin have required our complete sacrifice to the cause and it is our responsibility to protect the Royal Family to the death for whatever unexpected events may occur.”  The receiver is brought back down where Tirbaniski takes it from Solzheim hands and places in the cradle, while searching over Solzheim for any indication what the message was but the look of consideration on Solzheims’ face indicated it was not something simple.  
</p>
<p>
“Get Comrade Ulzanov and instruct him to gather the Royal Family together as they must all be aware of the circumstances we are now in and what their responsibilities will have to be”,  issued Comrade Solzheim.  Tirbaniski immediately grabbed his coat and went outside.  The air was cold, very cold, but the sun was bright and though still in the depths of winter a constant sense of hope, since the civil war was hundreds of miles away, the death and destruction had hardly reached this far part of Russia.  Standing on the makeshift platform to provide the widest scope of the landscape stood Ulzanov attentive to anything that might seem suspicious.  “Comrade Ulzanov I must replace your guard and you are to gather the Family into the main living quarters, there are instructions of pertinence they must be aware of.”  Descending from the platform Ulzanov, commenting on the weather enters into the schoolhouse.  
</p>
<p>
What he sets about is to first find the matriarchal head, Alexandra, to encourage the children to trust, once again, their safety is not in danger.  Knowing the Czar will be in his private chambers his thoughts lend to Alexandra accompanying him and knocks on the door.  There is a hesitation and then an answer, the Czar says, “Enter”.  Comrade Ulzanov, who has established the closest rapport, as he fares from the Moscow area and understands them more closely, turns the handle and walks abruptly into the room.  The expressions are still and uncertain, the two men stare into one another’s eyes for a fixed moment, and Ulzanov says in a somewhat cordial and military manner, “you must gather the children into the main living area as there are very important instructions you must hear.”  
</p>
<p>
Moments later in the main living area are gathered everybody but for Tirbaniski, including the seven other Red Army Guards ordered by Comrade Lenin himself to protect the Royal Family, and the Royal Family themselves.  
It is Ulzanov who is first to speak, only to calm everyone down for the disturbing news they are about to hear, it is Comrade Solzheim whose firm and steady voice begins, “I have just received news from Comrade Lenin directly, the White Army has broken through the Red Line at station 35, which means they can now reach this schoolhouse in a matter of hours, they do not intend to do any good for anyone and especially you Czar Nicholas and your family.  I have instructions from Comrade Lenin to protect you at all cost from whatever may happen, but it must be understood it may not be very effective, as you see my resources are very limited and they are very determined.”  
</p>
<p>
The look of concern returns to Czar Nicholas’s face as the children dressed in their winter clothes as they were likely playing outside in the snow, scan for their fathers response.  Still uncertain as to his place in these circumstances he reassures his wife and children there is nothing to fear as the people who are holding them have made every indication harm to them is the one thing they do not want to happen.  The Czar once again trusts his captors and retires to the authority of the Red Guards who are holding him here.  
</p>
<p>
A long night of anxiety for everyone ensues with the children only vaguely aware of the danger which is now imminently awaiting them, if the White Army gets to the schoolhouse they will surely kill everyone, but particularly the Czar.  It is the head of the Old World Order which they wish to capitulate and replace it with their shackles of Capitalism, mass exploitation of the Russian people and exhaustion of Russia for their own personal power.  Where the Czar is only acutely aware of the extent of determination they have to complete their objectives.  
</p>
<p>
At day break with little sleep for anyone there appears nothing different, the blessed sunrise over the wintery landscape, the slow working towards the noon hour, but there is a silence all around, even in the village where the schoolhouse is located.  Something ominous.
</p>
<p>
The smoke has finally settled and what appears as hundreds of White Army thugs burst into the main living area where the Royal Family stands waiting, the children frightened huddle behind Czar Nicholas.  “We have killed all your precious Red Guards, and what we started some time ago by getting rid of your witch doctor, Rasputin, we will now finish”, shouts one that appeared to be the leader, turning around yells at the two standing near the door, “take them into the kitchen room and kill them all.”
