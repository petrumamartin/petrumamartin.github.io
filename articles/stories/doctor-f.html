<h2>Doctor F</h2>
<p>
The air was damp with the evenings humidity, the previous few days were hotter than ever and the imminent feelings of a storm was everywhere.  As the sky darkened, the silence of what would follow was electric.  There was only now, it must be now, having come so far the doctor was preparing the final stages, it must produce the lightning required for this most crucial stage.  His assistant was moving about the place, hiding behind shadows and mumbling to himself, gathering this and that for his master.  There was a rumble in the distance, it was far away, but there was always the possibility of it getting closer, hope sprang eternal and the time might arrive where everything would coordinate elegantly.  There was a flash in the distance, it was now visible, the time has come.  Both the doctor and his assistant are now rushing about bringing all the pieces together, the platform has to be stabilized, the body adjusted, the wires attached to their appropriate location, and the current transformer calibrated to the optimal level.  
</p>
<p>
The roof door was retracted and again a bright flash, followed by the accompanying rumble, but this was a sharp snap, with a crack and burst of sound, excellent, the conditions are perfect, the best they have been.  The assistant begin to turn on the crank to raise the platform cage towards the ceiling roof, a groaning sound at each turn, the doctor with wide eyes watching each agonizing rotation, gestures with his hands approval of the steady effort his assistant is willing to offer.  A lurch and the cage begins to ascend, with rattling and jangling of metal now taunt with the tension of force applied to the pulling.  The doctor begins to adjust the platform cage with a cable guide as it begins to spin, anxiety now visible, his opportunity must not be missed. 
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the thought of what could be overlooked strikes the doctors mind, is everything perfect, or has something been missed, a look of horror widens his eyes as he absently peers over at the assistant, obliviously cranking at the ascension lever, absorbed completely in his work.  Settling his nerves he returns to making the guiding adjustments to align the platform with the ceiling opening.  Another streak of lightning, the entire laboratory is illuminated through the grotesque shadows thrown across the walls and floor.  Closer the platform is nearly there as the doctor urges his assistant with encouraging words of approval.  
</p> 
<p>
Contact, the platform cage is now docking with the ceiling opening complimenting rods, and suddenly the main latch is heard clicking shut, the cage is now fixedly in place, the assistant glances at the doctor, whose looked of excitement tells him everything, and clasping his hands together his eyes widen, his mouth opens as if to speak and jumps off the crank platform stand.  The doctor rushes to him and tells him to watch the two dials for any changes while he ascends up the tower stairs to where the body is positioned at the top.  
</p>
<p>
Throwing the hatch open, the blustering wind and sleet of rain beginning to pelt the night nearly knock him off his feet, but reaching for the stair banister he makes the final lunge into the night air.  The body, quiet, silent, still dead, waiting for the nourishing surge of life, holds the doctor enraptured.  His only thought now is to check the antenna rod, the key to this entire puzzle, for it is this rod which will draw the energy bound in the night sky down to earth, to the doctor, into his hands, his experiment, and through his apparatus, into the body of the dead creature, bringing him to life.  Aware now of the danger, standing near the lightning rod is under these circumstances, he cannot resist pressing closer and to settle his persisting concerns he inspects one more time the rod, where everything seeming to be exactly as he requires he peers into the torrential night sky and raising his hands upwards he curls his fingers together, squeezing them so tight the knuckles turn white, this must work.  
</p>
<p>
A flash of light and a crack forces the doctor to shield his face and cover his eyes, but for just an instance the doctor notices the lightning brushed his antenna, nothing, not enough, he needs more.  The doctor has placed a single apparatus dial on the upper observer platform and sees there needs more energy from the lightning.  Perhaps another will do, he waits, suddenly he is knocked off his feet as a blast of light and a surge of electrical ionized air makes the doctors own skin tingle with electrical charge.  He lunges to his feet, that blast was enough, the dial reads between the optimal level.  Suddenly his apparatus is alive, the electric current from the lightning is now surging through the machinery, calibrated to the specified requirements for the experiment towards the body on the platform above.  The electricity is now traveling through the cage and into the electrical wire implants that will bring the life inducing energy to the dead organic material.  The experiment is now at its crucial point, the make or break is here, what will happen in the next few moments will decide years of effort, the cost of organizing all the creatures to do the bidding of their masters, held obedient by the fear of their own shadows, to parade around and around without end, has to conclude as what must be.  
</p>
<p>
The cage is now glowing as the electrical resistance as the metal heats up, but this is expected, and the doctor now stares wildly at the carcass of sewn parts for any sign of life.  There is a sound from within the castle, at the base of the tower, it is the assistant whose anticipation he can no longer restrain utters an inaudible cry.  The sound of the tower trap door shutting is all he gets in response as the shadow of a figure slowly descends the stairs with his head hung down and shaking.
