<h1>The Quest for Truth</h1><hr />
<a href="statement.htm">Home</a>
<p>
  This is the nature of truth while it is something to consider it may never 
  be truly understood as it could only be something which does not meet the 
  requirements of a reality which is then a continuation of whatever may be 
  considered a valid interpretation of reality.
</p>
<p>
	What is then a valid interpretation of 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth#Definition_and_etymology">truth</a> 
  as it may pertain to something which is then considered a valid interpretation.  
  While it is likely the definition will always elude humans as there is such a 
  thing as that which is false<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> and by this conclusion 
  it may be assumed there is a notion that is truth.  It may be important to capitalize 
  the word 'truth' as Truth as to distinguish it from merely what is said in 
  confidentiality, that is what a child might say to their parent as to whether 
  the broken lamp was their fault.  What is pursued here as Truth is something 
  which extends beyond the limits of reality, that is the mere notion of what 
  is correct but that which has some intrinsic value or worth, that is potentially 
  life sustaining as such would be considered a means by which an end could be 
  accomplished.  The idea of a 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan#Christianity">deceiver</a> whose 
  intentions are beyond the natural and towards the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural#Demon">supernatural</a> which 
  is beyond the scope of the perceived world.
