<p>
  The story is a crude and brutal rendition of European French country life.  There is a papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; front, which may disguise what beneath is a natural world.  The story arc follows from beginning to end one character Jean or known locally as "Corporal" referring to his stint in the millitary during various campaigns.  The steady stream of characters introduce the course peasant and a small district of France near enough Paris that it is referred to throughout.

<p>
  If disturbing was the intention of the author they have achieved a completely unsettling narative.
