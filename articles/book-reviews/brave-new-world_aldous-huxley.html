  <p>
    There is elements of science fiction and of novella which bring together the main story line of a distopian future where mankind has eliminated suffering at the cost of humanity.  The impulse to ensure the world is at peace, brought about by constant conflict in the past a systematic reconstruction of every detail of life creates a pleasant but comical nightmare of order and mind control.  The rendering of the human condition towards the ridiculous quest for pleasure and distraction has brought even the processes of reproduction, arguably the root of "suffering", to the front; so detached, humans are manufactured in laboratories without the need of the archaic concepts of 'family', and laboratories replacing these forbidden entities; conditioning civilization according to requirements to achieve the primary objective of world peace.
