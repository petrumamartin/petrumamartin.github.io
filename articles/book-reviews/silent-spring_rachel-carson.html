  <h1>Book Review for Silent Spring by Rachel Carson<hr /></h1>
  
  <p>
    The realization the modern world has brought comforts and advantages that this book reveals there is a serious and awesome terror hiding behind everything as the attempt to control the natural world has indeed its price.  The introduction of chlorinated hydrocarbons to the arsenal to combat the difficulties of production, especially food.  The quest for a perfect world, one which has no bugs, abundant food supplies, and the comforts.  The chlorinated hydrocarbons took on many forms in the post-war years throughout the world, including the United States, but it was the most famous DDT, a spray which promised to kill everything that was not wanted and keep everything which was, had a problem.

  <p>
    The problem suggested by the author Rachel Carson was that research was not sufficient and the alternatives to DDT spraying would have afforded opportunities which did not get developed.
