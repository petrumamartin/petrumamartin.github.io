<h1>Review of Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad</h1>
<div id="content" style="margin:auto;width:600px">
<p>Throughout the book there is a constant sense of dread, of doom, of disaster, typical of <em>Joseph Conrad</em>, and there is the suggestion that something though has ended there is still some hope.  The <i>Patna</i> starts off the novel with the extended trial of events a ship hand by the name of <i>Jim</i>, haunted for the rest of his short life, is implicated as to his involvement during the ships sinking.  The tragedy is that hundreds of civilians who from some middle-eastern port were migrating somewhere were all lost, as the ship sank faster than could be thought possible.  The disaster of the <i>Patna</i> portends the fate of all the <b>British Empire</b> at that time, doomed to disintingration and ultimate disappearance, where the victims seem to represent all the hundreds of millions of colonists throughout the world sucked into the chaos of that disintegration.</p>
<p>While <i>Jim</i> is the central character his actual presence throughout the novel is scarce, he appears as a figure existing somewhere but with continuous tangencies with the narrator, <i>Marlow</i> whom the author describes in third person narrative where a narrator is narrating a narrator who is also a participant.  The life of <i>Jim</i> is described with a tendency towards reverence by <i>Marlow</i>, though <i>Jim</i> is not a recognized hero anywhere else.  There is some marr on his character because of the incident of the <i>Patna</i>, never really explained, but nonetheless he is for many years essentially unemployable.  With much effort and failed attempts the narrator, <i>Marlow</i>, tries to find him employment, he finally settles on a Malaysian colony as some kind of manager, where he begin to acquire trust and fame from the locals.  There is a crisis which will occur, a confrontation with pirates and <em>Yankees</em>.</p>
<p>What this could be is the realization the differences between the Americans and the British throughout the world at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century would bring about a shift in powers.  Though <i>Conrad</i> could not have forseen the dramatic shift that eventually did occur effective as <i>Lord Jim</i> died the torch would be passed to the Americans.  The death of <i>Lord Jim</i> does suggest the death of the <b>British Empire</b>, a character would as <em>Joseph Conrad</em> maintains was noble, has lost the vigour of the earlier centuries and the depiction of the Americans as desperate pirates indicates the likely sentiment towards the Americans at that time.  Their policy of manifest destiny was not only determined but imposed upon them by the world, including their competition for the torch of <b><i>good</i></b>.</p>
<p>The rich descriptive qualities and intoxicating vapours of <em>Conrad</em> are employed constantly.  References to sunset are dappled throughout, where the <b>British Empire</b> was once referred to as <q>the empire on which the sun would never set</q> was at the last chapter when <i>Lord Jim</i> has died refered to as <q>bleeding</q>.  While the Americans make a hasty getaway.</p>
<p>Hero and tragedy make for the main theme, <i>Lord Jim</i> is the tragic hero, recognized, and essentially betrayed by the <b>British Empire</b> as a reject and anti-hero, never to live again amongst civilization.  Condemned to the Malaysian outpost as his last recourse, he has resigned himself to live as an outcast for the rest of his days.  The narrator also speculates of the nature of the hero, and those who create them, who has the authority to create heroes and whether he himself has that authority.</p>
