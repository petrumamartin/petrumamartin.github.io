	<p class="description"><i>Rudolf</i> was a creation of the author Robert Lewis May, who while working for the Chicago Montgomery Ward retailer, was on assignment to improve a Christmas marketing campaign.  The idea of a ninth and youngest reindeer Santa would rely on to cut through the most challenging weather by the power of his bright shiny nose that lit the path for the other reindeer in harness behind him <i>Rudolf</i> was inspired.  Initially persecuted for this visible feature it is during one particularly difficult night of inclement weather where Santa relies on <i>Rudolf</i> to guide his sleigh that night.  It is then <i>Rudolf</i> finds acceptance amongst his peers and the story continues to this day.</p>
